  <p id="tribute-info">Lenny came to us during the first lockdown and he has brought us so much joy since then. I am going to share some of the highs and lows of our time together so far.</p>

    <!-- Timeline start -->
    
    <ul>
      <li> May 2020 - I collected tiny ball of fluff from <a target=_blank href="https://www.millstreamanimalshelter.co.uk/?p=0_home">Milstream Animal Shelter</a>, he had worms and an eye infection.</li> 
      <br>
        <li> June 2020 - Lenny was getting bigger and his medical issues were starting to improve so it was time for him to start exploring the flat and meet Lily, his new sister. All Lenny wanted to do was be close to her but she wasn't too sure.</li>
      <br>
          <li>July 2020 - Making progress: Lenny wanted to be just like Lily and copied everything that she did. He learnt lots of cat skills from watching her and his confidence was increasing. </li>
      <br>
      <li> August 2020 - We noticed that Lenny's breathing was unusual and he became out of breath very easily. Time for a trip to the vets.</li>
      <br>
      <li> August 2020 - We found out that Lenny has a rare condition called <a id="tribute-link" target=_blank href="https://www.kittenlady.org/pectus">pextus excavatum</a> which needed to be treated right away. </li>
      <br>
      <li> August 2020 - Lenny was booked into <a target=_blank href="https://www.woodcroftvets.com/practices/woodcroft-veterinary-hospital">Woodcroft Animal Hospital</a> where he underwent his life saving surgery. After the surgery he was required to wear a chest brace for 2 weeks. It was a very long couple of weeks. </li>
      <br>
      <li> September 2020 - The chest brace was removed and the surgery had been a sucess. HORAY!</li>
      <br>
      <li> October 2020 - Lenny started going outside for the first time. He was cautious at first but soon gained confidence and loved playing in the garden.</li>
      <br>
      <li> May 2021 - One year since Lenny came to live with us! It had been a challenging year but everything was going well and he was now thriving.</li>
        <br>
        <li>March 2022 - This brings us to today. Lenny is happy and healthy, he gets on well with Lily, he is very affectionate and enjoys playing indoors and outdoors.
